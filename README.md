This app has been written in Xcode 16.1 on MacOS Sequoia 15.3.2
The app has geometric shapes that can be used as a guide to calculate the amount of concrete required to fill the shapes.
The current geometric shapes are a box or slab, a round cylinder and a segment or wedge.
Apart from calculating the Area and Volume, the app also calculates the amount of cement required. 
The amount of cement required is shown in bags weighing 20kg, 25 kg and 30 kg.
